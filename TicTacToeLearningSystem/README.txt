PlayerStatus.py --> used by game.py to analyze a board and decide whether some player wins, loses or scores a tie in a tic tac toe game
1stPlot.png --> represents first plot outputted by main.py
2ndPlot.png --> represents second plot outputted by main.py
3rdPlot.png --> represents third plot outputted by main.py
playerPiece.txt --> outputted by main.py, tells which piece the player is using
playerResults.txt --> This file is outputted by main.py. It tells whether a player lost, won or scored a tie to an opponent during each training game. 
playerWeights.txt --> used by main.py to train a player
